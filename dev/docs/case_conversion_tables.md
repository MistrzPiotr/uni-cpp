## Overview

This document explains the implementation of Unicode case mapping lookup tables, including the use of [multistage lookup tables](./multistage-lookup-tables.md) and offset-based storage.

## Definitions

In this document, we define two types of case mappings:

- **Simple Mappings (1-to-1)**: These are mappings where one code point maps to exactly one other. For example, the lowercase letter `a` has an uppercase mapping to `A`. Another form of a simple mapping is when a code point has no defined case mapping; in such cases, it maps to itself. For example, the character `=` has a simple uppercase mapping to `=` (itself).
- **Special Mappings (1-to-N)**: These are mappings that expand one code point into multiple, such as German `ÃŸ` having an uppercase mapping to `SS`.

> **Note**: Context- or language-dependent mappings - such as the Turkish dotted and dotless I, or the Greek final sigma - are represented in these tables by their simple, context- and language-independent equivalents.

## Introduction

When optimizing storage for Unicode properties, [multistage lookup tables](./multistage-lookup-tables.md) often are an effective solution. They are effective because Unicode tends to group code points with similar properties into contiguous ranges. However, case mappings vary widely and rarely repeat, so storing them directly in multistage lookup tables would lead to poor compression. This makes it necessary to take a more creative approach - storing mappings in a form that repeats for multiple code points. To achieve this, we store offsets instead of absolute target values for simple mappings.

## Storing Offsets for Simple Mappings

The key idea is to store an offset instead of the target code point. This offset is calculated as the difference between the target code point and the original code point. Offsets are well suited for storing simple mappings in a way that allows contiguous ranges of code points to share the same value representation.

Consider the ASCII letter range as an example. If we store the target code points directly, each letter maps to a unique value - `'a'` maps to `'A'`, `'b'` maps to `'B'`, and so on. However, by storing offsets instead, all ASCII letters share the same offset value; for instance, both `'a'` and `'b'` have an offset of 32. This allows for more efficient grouping and storage.

Another benefit of using offsets is the ability to represent code points without case mappings - such as symbols or punctuation - as simple mappings with an offset of zero. This approach avoids the need for special handling and allows them to be efficiently grouped and compressed.

### Single Offset Table for All Case Types

As explained later, the offset table must be compact enough for its indexes to fit within 7 bits. To achieve this, we go beyond simply storing unique offset values: for lowercase mappings, we store the negated offsets, since they are typically the inverse of their corresponding uppercase offsets. This allows us to eliminate duplication and further reduce the size of the table.

For example, in the ASCII range, the uppercase mapping of the character `'a'` (`U+0061`) is `'A'` (`U+0041`), resulting in an offset of `-32`. In contrast, the lowercase mapping of `'A'` (`U+0041`) is `'a'` (`U+0061`), which corresponds to an offset of `+32`. Since these offsets are exact opposites, we only need to store one value (`32`) in the table, and apply it as-is for uppercase lookups or negate it for lowercase lookups.

## Compact Storage of Special Mappings

The longest special case mapping defined for a single code point in Unicode is three code points long (as of Unicode 16.0.0). This allows us to take advantage of the fixed maximum length and store each special case mapping compactly using 64 bits.

Although Unicode code points are typically stored as 32-bit integers (when not encoded), only 21 bits are actually required to represent any valid code point. This means that storing the maximum of three code points requires 63 bits in total, using 21 bits per code point.

The length of the mapping must also be encoded alongside the code points. Since we know the mapping is special and cannot exceed three code points, its length must be either two or three. Because the length is either 2 or 3, it can be represented using a single bit. A value of `0` in the length bit indicates a mapping of 2 code points, while a value of `1` indicates 3 code points - allowing the actual length to be derived by simply adding 2 to the bit's value.

In total, 63 bits are used to store the code points and 1 bit is used to encode the mapping's length, perfectly fitting into 64 bits.

The following table illustrates the bit layout of the 64-bit value.

|      MSB     |      21-bits     |      21-bits     |      21-bits     |
|--------------|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| [length-bit] | [3rd code point] | [2nd code point] | [1st code point] |

## Putting It All Together

To summarize, we have a table of simple mapping offsets, and a compact 64-bit format for storing special mappings. Building on that, we introduce three additional tables - each containing the unique special mappings for one case type: lowercase, uppercase, and titlecase.

In total, these four tables collectively represent all case mappings for every case type. The final piece is a mechanism to map any given code point to its corresponding case mapping.

For this, we use [multistage lookup tables](./multistage-lookup-tables.md). Since the multistage table is by far the largest among all the tables involved, it is desirable to use a single shared multistage lookup table for lowercase, uppercase, and titlecase lookups.

The multistage lookup tables map each code point to a value that encodes the case mapping information for all three case types: lowercase, uppercase, and titlecase. This value is divided into three 8-bit sections - one for each case type. Within each section, the most significant bit (MSB) serves as a flag indicating the type of mapping: if the bit is set, the mapping is special; if it is unset, the mapping is simple. For simple mappings, the remaining 7 bits are used as an index into the shared offset table. For special mappings, those 7 bits index into the corresponding special mappings table for that case type. The format is illustrated in the following table.

<table style="text-align: center;">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th colspan="8">32 bits</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th colspan="2">Unused<br>(8 bits)</th>
      <th colspan="2">Titlecase<br>(8 bits)</th>
      <th colspan="2">Uppercase<br>(8 bits)</th>
      <th colspan="2">Lowercase<br>(8 bits)</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td colspan="2">0x00</td>
      <td><strong>MSB</strong><br>(Flag)</td>
      <td><strong>Index</strong><br>(7 bits)</td>
      <td><strong>MSB</strong><br>(Flag)</td>
      <td><strong>Index</strong><br>(7 bits)</td>
      <td><strong>MSB</strong><br>(Flag)</td>
      <td><strong>Index</strong><br>(7 bits)</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

The final optimization involves limiting the multistage lookup tables to encode values only for code points up to the highest code point that has a mapping for a given case type. During lookup, if the code point exceeds this maximum, the process can return early, indicating the code point maps to itself.
